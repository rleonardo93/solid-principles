# Solid Principles

## Single-Responsibility Principle
"A class should have only one reason to change." - Robert C. Martin

## Open/Closed Principle
"Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification." - Bertrand Meyer

## Liskov Substitution Principle
"Subtype Requirement: Let p(x) be a property provable about objects x of type T. Then p(y) should be true for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T." - Barbara Liskov

## Interface Segregation Principle
"Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they not used" - Robert C. Martin

## Dependency Inversion Principle
"
    A. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
    B. Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions
" - Robert C. Martin
